# MyReads Project

This project was built for the **Udacity React Nanodegree Program**. A bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that it should be persisted information as user interacts with the application.

### How to Run
- Clone the Repository.
- Run **npm install** to install the project dependencies.
- Run the app using **npm start**.

### Backend API
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
